#Digilogue Clock

This is my WLED based "Digilogue" Clock. It uses a 60 LED ring to simulate an analogue style clock.

I have included all the STL files but also some 3MF for some parts. These either need supports or have specific layers to change the filament on. These are setup for a Prusa MK3s. The filamanet chages are at layer changes so no need for the MMU, just change when prompted by the printer!

Filaments I used for my project (not sponsored) are:
1. Ooznest Lucid Black
2. Ooznest Snow White
3. Ooznest Slate Grey

Filaments 1 and 2 are needed only for the clock face. Lucid black (which is a smoked like filiment) acts like a filter to increase the contrast of the display and Snow White is used to diffuse the light from the LEDs.

Filament 3 can be pretty much any solid colour you wish. I would advise against using pale, translucent or white filaments as the light will bleed between segments of the clock face. Darker colours are probably better.
